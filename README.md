`aggregate_icews` is an R function that aggregates the ICEWS data into count of within-country events based on the type of event and the actors involved. The function takes a dataframe as its sole argument and returns a dataframe.

```
aggregated_data = aggregate_icews(icews_data)
```

I've written a [blog post](http://bensfisher.com/aggregating-icews-data-in-r.html) that covers using and editing this function.
